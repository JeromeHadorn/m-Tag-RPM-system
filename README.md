# M-Tag System with reading position memory
## Python Implementation of M-Tag System with reading position memory
As a part of a university project, I've extended regular M-Tag systems with a memory feature. The reading position memory allows the tag system to decide based on the current state and symbol which reading position it should look at for the next ''iteration''.

There's a code implementation for regular M-Tag systems as well as for my computational model with reading position memory (RPM). There are two examples given that should demonstrate how to use both models to perform computation.
